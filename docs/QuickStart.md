# Vulkan2D Quickstart
Vulkan2D (VK2D) is a 2D/3D renderer written in C with Vulkan for small 2D games. It is
simple enough to use, but of course there is this guide to help with some of the details.

## The Basics
Everything that will be mentioned in this guide is mentioned in greater detail in the
documentation for any given function. Feel free to generate the doxygen docs or simply
read the header file containing the function for more information. The functions of
interest to the average user will be `vk2dRenderer*`, `vk2dTexture*`, `vk2dPolygon*`,
`vk2dCamera*`, `vk2dModel*`, and `vk2dShader*`.

Controlling the renderer is quite simple and only requires a few things:

 + Initialize it at the start of your program with `vk2dRendererInit`
 + Call `vk2dRendererStartFrame` each frame before you start drawing
 + Call `vk2dRendererEndFrame` at the end of each frame to finish drawing that frame
 + Once your program is done, use `vk2dRendererQuit` (but make sure to call `vk2dRendererWait` before freeing any VK2D resources)

Outside of those basics, there is a lot you can do with the renderer. Here are some of
the more interesting functions with a basic explanation:

 + `vk2dRendererSetConfig` lets you change renderer configuration whenever you want
 + `vk2dRendererSetBlendMode` will change the current blend mode letting you do cool effects
 like lighting
 + `vk2dRendererSetColourMod` changes the colour modifier which is applied to most drawing
 functions, you could set something like `[1, 0.5, 0.5, 1]` to make everything more red
 + `vk2dRendererGetAverageFrameTime` returns the average amount of time taken between start
 and end of each frame
 + `vk2dRendererGetLimits` returns a structure containing information on what the user's
 machine is capable of

## Drawing

Drawing in VK2D is done through the renderer, the draw functions at the time of writing are

 + `vk2dRendererDrawRectangle` - Draws filled rectangles with the current render colour modifier
 + `vk2dRendererDrawRectangleOutline` - Draws rectangle outlines with the current render colour modifier
 + `vk2dRendererDrawCircle` - Draws filled circles with the current render colour modifier
 + `vk2dRendererDrawCircleOutline` - Draws circle outlines with the current render colour modifier
 + `vk2dRendererDrawLine` - Draws a line with the current render colour modifier
 + `vk2dRendererDrawTexture` - Draws a texture
 + `vk2dRendererDrawShader` - Draws a texture using a user-provided shader
 + `vk2dRendererDrawPolygon` - Draws a polygon
 + `vk2dRendererDrawGeometry` - Draws a list of vertices without the need for a `VK2DPolygon`
 + `vk2dRendererDrawModel` - Draws a 3D model
 + `vk2dRendererAddBatch` - Queues many `vk2dRendererDrawTexture`s at once, useful for multi-threading or just more control

They all also have some macros to make them a little less cumbersome to use. Check the documentation for
more details on each one, as only some of the FAQ stuff will be covered here.

In VK2D, coordinates start at the top-left of the screen and go left-to-right.

![image](./docs/screenspace.png)

In effect, something drawn with a y-value of 300 will be further down the display than something drawn with
a y-value of 100. This means the y-axis is opposite to how you might be used to it in math - it will make
more sense when you start working with it. The x-axis is "normal" though.

Rotation is always done with radians in VK2D and all rotation follow the same pattern:

![image](./docs/rotations.png)

All rotations start from what would be East on a compass and go clockwise. In addition, a texture/rectangle
origin of 0/0 represents the top-left corner just like screen space. This means that if you were to take a
texture such as

![image](./docs/rotationexample1.png)

and rotate by half of pi, you would get

![image](./docs/rotationexample2.png)

(It moved to the side.)

If you were to set the origin to half of the texture's width and height, you would instead get

![image](./docs/rotationexample3.png)

Notice how it rotated in place instead of moving to the side.

By default, circle's origins are at their center, however. 3D models play by completely different rules
defined by your models and however your 3D cameras are set up.

## Textures
Textures are the primary way of drawing images to the screen. You can load textures with `vk2dTextureLoad`
and `vk2dTextureFrom`, then draw them however you want. More interestingly, you can create textures to
render to with `vk2dTextureCreate`. Textures created this way can be rendered to in the same way you would
draw to the screen, just call `vk2dRendererSetTarget` on it then you can render whatever you want to the
texture. This is useful when you want to render a lot of something once, then just display that instead
of rendering a lot of it every frame. Some common pitfalls to avoid here are:

 + Textures are stored in VRAM, and you have limited amounts of it
 + Textures must be drawn to completely before rendering them, usually you may simply use `vk2dRendererEmpty`
 after setting the render target to a texture - failure to do so ***will*** cause crashes on certain hardware
 without warning
 + You may only render textures created this way when they are not the current render target (switch back to
 `VK2D_TARGET_SCREEN` before drawing a target texture)

Additionally, texture targets have a coordinate space identical to that of the screen by default - the origin
is the top-left and the y-axis goes down. You may use `vk2dRendererSetTextureCamera` to use user-defined cameras
on texture targets instead of their default texture space. This still has the side effect of ignoring the cameras'
`xOnScreen`, `yOnScreen`, `wOnScreen`, and `hOnScreen` parameters because the viewport will simply be set to the
texture's dimensions.

### Sprite Batching
Strongly related to drawing textures is sprite-batching. As of right now, only textures are batched automatically,
meaning drawing textures is heavily hardware-accelerated to be as fast as possible since that's probably what 90%
of your drawing will be in a game. To better make use of this feature, try to keep as much texture drawing together
as possible, since everytime you use a draw command other than `vk2dRendererDrawTexture` the current batch is flushed.
Alternatively, you may just build your own list of `VK2DDrawCommand`s and submit them with `vk2dRendererAddBatch`
as to give yourself complete control over when your sprite batch is submitted. This, however, is a very minor optimization
and in general even blatantly disregarding this feature will still result in good performance as most of the heavy
lifting will be done on the GPU all the same. 

## Polygons
VK2D provides a few drawing primitives, but if you want more detailed shapes, you may load your own with
`vk2dPolygonShapeCreateRaw` and `vk2dPolygonCreate`. `vk2dPolygonShapeCreateRaw` lets you specify your own vertices
with specified colours, but the input must be triangulated; the example in `examples/main` does this. `vk2dPolygonCreate`
lets you create arbitrary polygons with just a list of `vec2`'s, and will automatically triangulate the input. Polygons
created with `vk2dPolygonCreate` will be solid white and their colour can be modified by changing the renderer's
colour modifier.

## Cameras
Cameras are a way to look into the game world with lots of powerful features. You may create up to a certain
number of cameras yourself, and by default the renderer will render to all of them at once to allow for things
like mini-maps or split-screen (see the split-screen example in `examples/` for implementation details). You
may also use `vk2dRendererLockCameras` to force the renderer to only render to a specific camera.

The first camera is always reserved for the renderer, you may refer to it as `VK2D_DEFAULT_CAMERA` and while you
may update it, its recommended to leave it for UI drawing because it will be changed by the renderer without
warning whenever the window is resized.

To create and use a camera, you need a camera specification (`VK2DCameraSpec`) and camera index (`VK2DCameraIndex`).
The spec is how you provide the renderer with the data it needs to render your world, and the index is how you
keep track of the cameras you make. Most of the spec parameters are simple and well documented, we will use some
examples will be used.

In the images below the black border represents what part of the game world the camera is viewing.

![image](./docs/cameraexample-1.png)

Cameras simply view a portion of the game world. You may do things like rotate the camera, zoom in, and move it.

![image](./docs/cameraexample-2.png)

The 4 fields, `xOnScreen`, `yOnScreen`, `wOnScreen`, and `hOnScreen` control the viewport for the camera. This means
`xOnScreen` and `yOnScreen` controls the x and y position in the game window where the camera will be displayed from
and `wOnScreen` and `hOnScreen` controls the width and height of the camera in the game window. `wOnScreen` and 
`hOnScreen` are completely independent from the cameras `w` and `h` variables; you may have a camera with `w` and `h`
much smaller than `wOnScreen` and `hOnScreen`, in fact the example in `examples/retrolook` does exactly that.

![image](./docs/cameraexample-3.png)

## Models
Models are a way of drawing 3D models, and they are loaded in similar fashion to Polygons. You may load a model from
vertices using `vk2dModelCreate`, which also expects that the input be triangulated. You may load models from a .obj
file using `vk2dModelLoad` or `vk2dModelFrom`. All models are expected to be UV mapped and you must provide the texture
yourself.

To actually draw the 3D models, you need a 3D camera. Cameras in general were described above but some specifics for 3D
will be discussed here

 + 3D cameras must have the type `VK2D_CAMERA_TYPE_PERSPECTIVE` or `ct_Orthogonal` for VK2D to actually render 3D models to them
 + Cameras with the type `VK2D_CAMERA_TYPE_DEFAULT` will simply not have 3D models drawn to them even if you call `vk2dRendererDrawModel`
 with the renderer locked to such cameras
 + The camera spec parameters `x`, `y`, `w`, `h`, `zoom`, and `rot` are ignored for 3D cameras in favour of the parameters
 in `VK2DCameraSpec.Perspective.*`

The example `examples/retrolook` shows a very simple setup and usage of a 3D camera, and the example `examples/main`
has a 3D camera moving with the mouse.

## Shaders
You may provide your own SPIR-V compiled shaders to render textures with. For a detailed example check `examples/main`.

Shaders may be loaded with `vk2dShaderLoad` and `vk2dShaderFrom`, and if you specify a buffer size other than 0 you
must provide `vk2dRendererDrawShader` with a data buffer of at least that size. For some specifics,

 + Your shaders must have the same inputs and outputs as the shader in `assets/test.frag`/`assets/test.vert`
 + Shader buffer size must be a multiple of 4
 + To specify a uniform buffer, you must specify the size when you create the shader and use

The fragment shader should have the following information before the main entry point:

```glsl
#version 450
#extension GL_ARB_separate_shader_objects : enable
#extension GL_EXT_scalar_block_layout : enable
#extension GL_EXT_nonuniform_qualifier : enable

// VK2D provided variables
layout(push_constant) uniform PushBuffer {
    int cameraIndex;
    uint textureIndex;
    vec4 texturePos;
    vec4 colour;
    mat4 model;
} push;

layout(set = 0, binding = 0) uniform UniformBufferObject {
    mat4 viewproj[10];
} ubo;

layout(set = 1, binding = 1) uniform sampler texSampler;
layout(set = 2, binding = 2) uniform texture2D tex[];

// Input from the vertex shader
layout(location = 1) in vec2 fragTexCoord;
layout(location = 2) in vec4 fragColour;

// Output of the fragment shader
layout(location = 0) out vec4 outColor;

// Optional user-provided uniform buffer
layout(set = 3, binding = 3) uniform UserData {
    float colour;
} userData;

void main() {
    // your code here
}
```

And for the vertex shader:

```glsl
#version 450
#extension GL_ARB_separate_shader_objects : enable

// Required for VK2D
const vec2 VERTICES[] = {
    vec2(0.0f, 0.0f),
    vec2(1.0f, 0.0f),
    vec2(1.0f, 1.0f),
    vec2(1.0f, 1.0f),
    vec2(0.0f, 1.0f),
    vec2(0.0f, 0.0f),
};

const vec2 TEX_COORDS[] = {
    vec2(0.0f, 0.0f),
    vec2(1.0f, 0.0f),
    vec2(1.0f, 1.0f),
    vec2(1.0f, 1.0f),
    vec2(0.0f, 1.0f),
    vec2(0.0f, 0.0f),
};

layout(push_constant) uniform PushBuffer {
    int cameraIndex;
    uint textureIndex;
    vec4 texturePos;
    vec4 colour;
    mat4 model;
} push;

layout(set = 0, binding = 0) uniform UniformBufferObject {
    mat4 viewproj[10];
} ubo;

// Output to the fragment shader
layout(location = 0) out vec4 gl_Position;
layout(location = 1) out vec2 fragTexCoord;
layout(location = 2) out vec4 fragColour;

// Optional user-provided uniform buffer
layout(set = 3, binding = 3) uniform UserData {
    float colour;
} userData;

void main() {
    // your code here
}
```
